# UWP on Xbox One

Get started building apps for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) on Xbox One.

This preview release supports developing both apps and games. You don't need to be an [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id) developer to experiment, create, and test games or apps on Xbox, but you do need to enroll with [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id) if you want to publish and sell a game on Xbox One or take advantage of Xbox Live on Windows 10. To join our community of independent developers and enthusiasts, register for [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id). 

This section includes setup steps, a guide through the authentication process, information about installing the required versions of Visual Studio and Windows 10 tools, and the steps to build, run, and debug your first simple application.
