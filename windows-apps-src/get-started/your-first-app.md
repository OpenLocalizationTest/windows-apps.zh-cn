# Create your first app

It's easier than you think to create a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app for Windows 10. You don't need to learn a new language to startâ€”you can create it with what you already know:

-   C# or Visual Basic with XAML
-   C++ with XAML
-   JavaScript with HTML/CSS

These tutorials help you create your first UWP app in the language of your choice. Here, you'll learn how to:

-   Create a UWP app project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
-   Add UI elements and code to the project.
-   Build and debug your app on the local machine and on a phone emulator.

To get started, choose the language you prefer.

## C#/Visual Basic and XAML tutorials

Use your .NET, WPF, or Silverlight skills to build apps using XAML with C# or Visual Basic.
