# Create IAP descriptions


When submitting an IAP, the info you provide in the **Descriptions** step will be displayed to your app's customers. Make sure to consider the description carefully in order to represent your IAP accurately in a way that makes it appealing to customers. You can provide customized descriptions for different languages.

## Languages


Before you can enter description info, you need to specify one or more [languages](supported-languages.md). We recommend providing descriptions for every language your app supports.

Under the **Descriptions** section of your IAP’s submission, click **Manage description languages**, then click **Manage languages** on the next page. Check the boxes for the languages that you’d like to add, then click **Update**. The languages that you’ve selected will be displayed in the **Description languages** section of the page. To remove one or more of these languages, click **Remove** (or click **Manage languages** and uncheck the box for languages you’d like to remove). Click **Save** when you're happy with the list of languages.

> **Tip** To add and remove additional languages, click **Manage description languages** from the IAP submission overview.

To edit a description, click the language name on the IAP submission overview. The info you can enter for each language is described below.

## Title

You must provide a title here, which is the name your customers will see for this IAP. Your title can be up to 100 characters.

## Description

If you'd like to display more info than just a title, you can enter up to 200 characters here. This field is optional.

## Icon

You also have the option to provide an image that may be displayed when the user buys the product. This icon must be a .png file that measures exactly 300 x 300 pixels.
