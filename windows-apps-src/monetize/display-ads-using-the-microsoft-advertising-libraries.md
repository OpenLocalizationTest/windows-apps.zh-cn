# Display ads using the Microsoft advertising libraries


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Use the Microsoft advertising libraries in the [Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK](monetize-your-app-with-the-microsoft-store-engagement-and-monetization-sdk.md) to show banner and video interstitial ads in your XAML or JavaScript/HTML apps for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.

> **Important**   The Microsoft advertising libraries are a different set of extensions from the ad mediation libraries. For more information about the differences between the ad mediation and Microsoft advertising libraries, see [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md). For information about using ad mediation, see [Use ad mediation to maximize revenue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/use-ad-mediation-to-maximize-revenue).
