# Submit an app with ads to the Windows Store


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

After you finish developing your app with ads, you can publish your app to the Windows Dev Center dashboard so it is available in the Windows Store. For more information about this process, see [Publish Windows apps](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/publish).

All apps submitted to the Windows Store must follow the [Windows Store Policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn764944.aspx) and terms specified in the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx). Apps that use the Microsoft advertising libraries must meet the additional requirements that are specified in Exhibit E of the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx).
