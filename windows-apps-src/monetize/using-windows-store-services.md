| [Access analytics data](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md) | Use the <em>Windows Store analytics API</em> to programmatically retrieve analytics data for apps that are registered to your or your organization's Windows Dev Center account. This API enables you to retrieve data for app and IAP acquisitions, app failures, app ratings and reviews. |
| [View and grant products from a service](view-and-grant-products-from-a-service.md)  | If you have a catalog of apps and in-app products (IAPs), you can use the Windows Store collection API and Windows Store purchase API to access ownership information for these products from your services.  |
