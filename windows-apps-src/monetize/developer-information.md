# Developer information about the Microsoft advertising libraries


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

The topics in this section provide useful information to developers about the Microsoft advertising libraries in the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK.

  > **Important**   The Microsoft advertising libraries are a different set of extensions from the ad mediation libraries. Use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) and [InterstitialAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.aspx) classes in the Microsoft advertising libraries if you want to display banner or video interstitial ads from Microsoft in a XAML or JavaScript app. Use the **AdMediatorControl** class in the ad mediation libraries if you want to display banner ads from multiple ad networks in a XAML app. For more information, see [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md).
