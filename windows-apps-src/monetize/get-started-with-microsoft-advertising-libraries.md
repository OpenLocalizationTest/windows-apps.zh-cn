# Get started with the Microsoft advertising libraries


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

This topic provides the information you need to get started using the Microsoft advertising libraries to add banner and video interstitial ads to your apps. After you have read the topics in this section, move on to the [developer walkthroughs](developer-walkthroughs.md) to see examples about how to write the code that will show ads in your apps.

For complete sample projects that demonstrate how to add banner and video interstitial ads to JavaScript/HTML apps and XAML apps using C# and C++, see the [advertising samples on GitHub](http://aka.ms/githubads).

>**Important**   The Microsoft advertising libraries are a different set of extensions from the ad mediation libraries. Use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) and [InterstitialAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.aspx) classes in the Microsoft advertising libraries if you want to display banner or video interstitial ads from Microsoft in a XAML or JavaScript app. Use the **AdMediatorControl** class in the ad mediation libraries if you want to display banner ads from multiple ad networks in a XAML app. For more information, see [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md).
