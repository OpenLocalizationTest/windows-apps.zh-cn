# Release notes for the Microsoft advertising libraries


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

This section provides release notes for the current release of the Microsoft advertising libraries in the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK. These libraries support XAML and JavaScript/HTML apps for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.

## Installation


The Microsoft advertising libraries are available as part of the [Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK](http://aka.ms/store-em-sdk). For all project types other than Windows Phone 8.x Silverlight, the Microsoft Advertising assemblies that used to be distributed in the earlier standalone releases of the Microsoft Universal Ad Client SDK and Microsoft Advertising SDK are now installed with the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK. For more information about installing the SDK and the libraries that are included in it, see [Install the Microsoft advertising libraries](install-the-microsoft-advertising-libraries.md).

To get the Microsoft advertising assemblies for Windows Phone 8.x Silverlight projects, install the [Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK](http://aka.ms/store-em-sdk), open your project in Visual Studio, and then go to **Project** > **Add Connected Service** > **Ad Mediator** to automatically download the assemblies. After doing this, you can remove the ad mediator references from your project if you do not want to use ad mediation. For more information, see [AdControl in Windows Phone Silverlight](adcontrol-in-windows-phone-silverlight.md).

## Understanding the difference between Microsoft advertising libraries and ad mediation

Although both the Microsoft advertising libraries and the ad mediation libraries are provided by the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK, these libraries serve different purposes. Use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) and [InterstitialAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.aspx) classes in the Microsoft advertising libraries if you want to display banner or video interstitial ads from Microsoft in a XAML or JavaScript app. Use the **AdMediatorControl** class in the ad mediation libraries if you want to display banner ads from multiple ad networks in a XAML app (ad mediation is not supported for JavaScript/HTML apps). For more information, see [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md).

## Uninstall previous versions

Before you install the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK, it is highly recommended that you uninstall all prior instances of the Microsoft Universal Ad Client SDK or the Microsoft Advertising SDK.

## Target architecture-specific build outputs

When using the Microsoft advertising libraries, you cannot target **Any CPU** in your project. If your project targets the **Any CPU** platform, you may see a warning in your project after you add a reference to the Microsoft advertising libraries. To remove this warning, update your project to use an architecture-specific build output (for example, **x86**). For more information, see [Known issues](known-issues-for-the-advertising-libraries.md).

## C++ Support

The Microsoft advertising libraries (which include the **AdControl** and **InterstitialAd** classes) support apps written in C++ and DirectX using Windows Runtime Interoperability (*interop*). For more information and examples about programming using XAML and C++, see [Type System](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh755822.aspx).

## No toolbox control

In the current release of the Microsoft advertising libraries in the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK, there is no toolbox control for dragging an **AdControl** or **InterstitialAd** to a design surface in your app. For instructions about adding these controls in your markup and code, see the [developer walkthroughs](developer-walkthroughs.md).

## Latitude and longitude properties no longer available

The **AdControl** class no longer has **Latitude** and **Longitude** properties for UWP apps. Instead, code built into the ad control will detect and send these values to the ad servers on the appâ€™s behalf.

## Important notice

Be sure to read the end user license agreement (EULA) in its entirety. See the topic [Important notice - EULA](important-notice-eula.md).
